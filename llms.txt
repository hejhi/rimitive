# Lattice

> A modular reactive UI framework for TypeScript. Compose signals, views, and behaviors into applications with fine-grained reactivity.

Lattice uses `compose()` to wire modules together. Modules declare dependencies; compose resolves them automatically. The result is a service with reactive primitives.

## Core Concepts

- [llms-full.txt](llms-full.txt): Complete LLM documentation (recommended for full context)

## Quick Reference

Signal primitives: `signal(value)` creates state; `sig()` reads; `sig(newValue)` writes; `sig.peek()` reads without tracking.

Effects are synchronous - they run immediately when dependencies change.

View elements: `el(tag).props({...})(...children)` - curried pattern. Specs are inert; call `.create(svc)` or `mount()` to instantiate.

Behaviors: `(svc) => (options) => { return api }` - portable reactive logic.

## Import Patterns

```typescript
// Modules for composition
import { SignalModule, ComputedModule, EffectModule } from '@lattice/signals/extend';

// Types only
import type { Readable, Writable, SignalFunction } from '@lattice/signals';

// View factories
import { createElModule } from '@lattice/view/el';
import { createDOMAdapter } from '@lattice/view/adapters/dom';

// Compose into a service
import { compose } from '@lattice/lattice';
const svc = compose(SignalModule, ComputedModule, EffectModule);
```
