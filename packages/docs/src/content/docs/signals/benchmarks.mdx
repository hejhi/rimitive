description: Performance benchmarks comparing Rimitive signals to other reactive libraries.
---

import SignalsBenchmarks from '../../../components/SignalsBenchmarks.astro';

Performance is a core focus of Rimitive. We regularly benchmark against other popular reactive libraries to ensure competitive performance.

## Framework Comparison

These benchmarks measure core signal operations like reading, writing, and propagating changes through dependency graphs.

## Methodology

- Benchmarks run using [mitata](https://github.com/evanwashere/mitata) with garbage collection enabled
- Each benchmark runs multiple iterations to ensure statistical significance
- Results show median time per operation (lower is better)
- Ratios compare against Rimitive (1.00x = same speed)

## Running Locally

To run benchmarks on your own machine:

```bash
cd packages/benchmarks
pnpm bench              # Run all benchmarks
pnpm bench diamond      # Run specific benchmark
pnpm bench --docs       # Run and update docs data
```
