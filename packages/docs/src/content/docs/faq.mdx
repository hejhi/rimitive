---

## Why?

See [Why Rimitive?](/why/) for the full story.

---

## Is it fast/tiny/etc?

Yes:

- ⚡️ Performance is on par with Preact and alien-signals (see our [benchmarks](/benchmarks/))
- 📦 Bundle sizes are tiny and gruesomely tree-shake-able. No compilation required—compose only what you need, and unless a package or module is specifically for the DOM, it's entirely environment agnostic with no global state (safe for SSR and React concurrent mode).
- 🌝 Type-safe all the way down

---

## Will it work with [my favorite framework]?

Only React bindings so far, but look at those bindings—they're simple. Try writing one "yourself" (i.e., with Claude) with the ergonomics you prefer! No bindings needed for vanilla TypeScript.

---

## Are there docs and examples?

You're looking at the docs! And yes, there are [examples](https://github.com/hejhi/rimitive/tree/main/packages/examples).

---

## Are there devtools?

Perhaps overly granular, but yes (and powered by Rimitive!).

---

## Are there tests?

Many.

---

## SSR and React concurrent mode?

No module-level or global state—each `compose()` call creates isolated state, so it's safe for SSR (multiple requests) and React concurrent mode (interrupted renders).

---

## "Rimitive primitives"??

Leave. me. be. I hate naming.
