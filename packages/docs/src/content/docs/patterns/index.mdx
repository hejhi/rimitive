title: Patterns
description: Common patterns for building Rimitive applications.
---

Rimitive is intentionally minimal. It provides reactive primitives and modules—signals, computed, effects, elements, fragments—and lets you compose them into whatever patterns fit your needs.

This section covers common patterns you'll encounter when building with Rimitive. These aren't special APIs or hidden features—they're just idiomatic ways to solve common problems using the primitives you already have.

---

## Available Patterns

### [Signal Patterns](/patterns/signal-patterns/)
Common patterns for working with signals: updaters, derived actions, debouncing, async actions, and more.

### [Forms](/patterns/forms/)
Patterns for building reactive forms with validation, field composition, and submission handling.

### [Behaviors](/patterns/behaviors/)
Headless, reusable UI logic. State and actions without the markup.

### [Portability](/patterns/portability/)
Write once, run anywhere—Rimitive views, React, custom renderers.

### [Shared State](/patterns/shared-state/)
How to share state across components without prop drilling. Spoiler: the service is the context.

### [Error Handling](/patterns/error-handling/)
How to handle errors in Rimitive applications. Spoiler: use try/catch.

### [Async Loading States](/patterns/async-loading/)
How to handle loading, error, and ready states for async data using resources and match.

### [Composition Over Stores](/patterns/composition-over-stores/)
Why Rimitive doesn't have stores, and what to do instead.

## Philosophy

These patterns share a common thread: **explicitness over magic**.

- Shared state is explicit service threading, not implicit context lookup
- Error handling is try/catch, not a special boundary component
- Async states are data you render, not suspense boundaries that hide loading
- State is composed behaviors, not proxy-wrapped objects
- DOM access is callbacks with cleanup, not magical ref objects

This isn't about purity—it's about predictability. When something goes wrong (and it will), you can trace exactly what happened because there's no hidden machinery.

If you're coming from React or Solid, some of this might feel verbose at first. Give it time. The explicitness pays off when debugging, testing, and reasoning about your code.
