Rimitive isn't a framework—it's a composition system and reactive primitive library. Compose modules into services that provide only the primitives you actually need:

```typescript
const { signal, computed, el, mount } = compose(
  SignalModule,
  ComputedModule,
  createElModule(domAdapter),
  MountModule
);
```

Need just signals? Compose just signals. Need SSR? Swap the adapter. Want to replace the reactive graph entirely? Swap the modules.

## What Makes It Different

**Portable behaviors.** Your reactive logic isn't tied to a component model. Write a `disclosure` behavior once, use it in Rimitive views, React, or anything else that speaks signals.

**No framework boundary.** The same behavior that powers your dropdown can power your accordion, modal, and tooltip—across different apps, different frameworks, same code.

**Transparent architecture.** Every layer is swappable: the reactive graph, the scheduler, the renderer. Rimitive's own primitives are built with `defineModule()`—the same tool you have.

## Performance

On par with the fastest reactive libraries. See the [benchmarks](/benchmarks/).
