The view layer is designed for optimal performance at any scale. These benchmarks demonstrate that operations maintain efficient time complexity as data grows.

## Scaling Characteristics

These benchmarks measure how view operations scale with increasing data sizes. The goal is to maintain linear or better time complexity.

## What to Look For

- **O(1) - Constant Time**: Operations that take the same time regardless of list size. This is ideal for operations like append/prepend that only touch a few elements.
- **O(n) - Linear Time**: Operations where time grows proportionally with input size. Expected for operations that must process each item (like initial render or full replacement).
- **O(n²) - Quadratic Time**: Red flag! Time grows with the square of input size. We avoid this through careful algorithm design.

## Key Optimizations

1. **Tail pointer tracking** - Append operations are O(1), not O(n)
2. **LIS-based reconciliation** - Minimal DOM moves when reordering
3. **Keyed diffing** - Element reuse when items move

## Running Locally

```bash
cd packages/benchmarks
pnpm bench                  # Run all benchmarks
pnpm bench map/append       # Run specific view benchmark
pnpm bench --docs           # Run and update docs data
```
