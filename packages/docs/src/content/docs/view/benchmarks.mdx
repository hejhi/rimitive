import ViewBenchmarks from '../../../components/ViewBenchmarks.astro';

The view layer is designed for optimal performance at any scale. These benchmarks measure how view operations scale with increasing data sizes.

<ViewBenchmarks />

## Key Optimizations

1. **Tail pointer tracking** - Append operations are O(1), not O(n)
2. **LIS-based reconciliation** - Minimal DOM moves when reordering
3. **Keyed diffing** - Element reuse when items move

## Running Locally

```bash
cd packages/benchmarks
pnpm bench                  # Run all benchmarks
pnpm bench map/append       # Run specific view benchmark
pnpm bench --docs           # Run and update docs data
```
