title: Creating a Service
description: The most basic Rimitive setup—composing modules into a reactive service.

To use Rimitive, start by creating a **reactive service**. Services and modules are constructs of our flyweight dependency injection (DI) system in [`core`](https://github.com/hejhi/rimitive/packages/core) (the DI system, which can be used outside of Rimitive as well).

The simplest example of a reactive service:

```typescript
import { compose } from '@rimitive/core';
import { SignalModule } from '@rimitive/signals/extend';

const svc = compose(SignalModule);
const { signal } = svc;
```

- A **service** is the result of calling `compose()`. It bundles selected modules into an isolated reactive context.
- A **module** is what you provide to `compose()`. Modules can depend on other modules, and `compose()` bundles everything up into a service where they all share the same underlying reactive graph.

Using `svc` to represent a service is a convention you'll see used throughout these docs.

This service wouldn't do much on its own—nothing is connected to react to signal changes yet.

## Adding More Modules

We can add some more modules that _would_ react to signal updates:

```typescript
import { compose } from '@rimitive/core';
import { SignalModule, ComputedModule, EffectModule } from '@rimitive/signals/extend';

const { signal, computed, effect } = compose(SignalModule, ComputedModule, EffectModule);
```

Then use them:

```ts
const count = signal(0);
const doubled = computed(() => count() * 2);

effect(() => {
  console.log('Count is now:', count());
});

// ...etc
```

Reactive dependencies are automatically tracked in Rimitive, so you don't need to worry about it.

## Why `compose()`?

Each `compose()` call creates an independent reactive context with no global leakage. This means:

- **Isolation**: Multiple services don't interfere with each other
- **Testing**: Fresh contexts per test, no cleanup needed
- **Tree-shaking**: Only bundle what you use
- **Extensibility**: Add [view modules](/guides/adding-a-ui), [router](/guides/adding-routing), or [custom modules](/guides/custom-modules) later
