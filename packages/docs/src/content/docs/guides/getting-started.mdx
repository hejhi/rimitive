import SandboxDir from '../../../components/SandboxDir.astro';

<SearchTags tags={["getting-started", "installation", "setup", "quickstart", "hello-world", "first-app"]} />

## Installation

```bash
npm install @rimitive/core @rimitive/signals
```

<SearchTags tags={["counter", "example", "tutorial", "reactive-state", "dom-rendering"]} />

## Your First App

Create a counter with reactive state and DOM rendering. Start by installing the deps:

```bash
npm install @rimitive/core @rimitive/signals @rimitive/view
```

Then, create the app:

<SandboxDir dir="getting-started" editorHeight="320px" />

That's it! Click the button, the count updates, the DOM updates automatically.

## What Just Happened?

1. **`compose()`** wires modules together into a service
2. **`signal()`** creates reactive state — read with `count()`, write with `count(newValue)`
3. **`computed()`** derives values that update when dependencies change
4. **`el()`** creates DOM elements with reactive children and props
5. **`mount()`** attaches the element tree to the DOM

If you're lost already, don't worry. We'll start from the very basics. These docs also cover reactive patterns in-depth, so you can jump around if you get confused at any time.

Rimitive is as much about patterns as it is about reactive modules and tooling, so if at any point you hate it, you can always take any patterns that inspired you elsewhere!
