A **behavior** is, like many things in rimitive, simply a pattern. It's a function that encapsulates reactive state, with actions to drive that state, into a reusable unit. Again, no UI or component framework, just a nice convention to encapsulate reactive logic.

<Aside type="note">
As mentioned in the previous section, behaviors are _just functions_. They aren't themselves reactive, despite us prefixing with `use*`, my React peeps. There's no re-rendering. In rimitive, **all reactivity is encapsulated in primitives**.

## The Simple Approach

The easiest way to create a behavior is to import primitives directly from your service:

```typescript
// behaviors/useCounter.ts
import { signal, computed } from '../service';

// Again, use* is just a convention, this is not prescribed and not React!
export const useCounter = (initial = 0) => {
  const count = signal(initial);
  const doubled = computed(() => count() * 2);

  return {
    count,
    doubled,
    increment: () => count(count() + 1),
    decrement: () => count(count() - 1),
    reset: () => count(initial),
  };
};
```

Use it anywhere:

```typescript
import { useCounter } from './behaviors/useCounter';

const counter = useCounter(10);
counter.increment();
counter.count();  // 11
```

## The Portable Pattern

When you need behaviors that work across different contexts—testing with mocks, sharing between apps, or SSR—use the portable pattern. This is, generally speaking, the preferred pattern.

### The Shape

```typescript
// Remember how we exported `typeof svc` in the previous guide example?
import type { Service } from './service';

// The "portable" pattern is...just wrapping your behavior in an outer
// function that injects the service
const myPortableBehavior = (svc: Service) => (options?) => {
  // Create state
  // Return API
};
```

This silly little pattern doesn't look like much but opens up a whole world of fun possibilities. It also decouples your function from Rimitive! you could pass in whatever you want for `svc` later, as long as it matches the Service type. So from now on, we'll be working with portable functions.

### A Counter Example

```typescript
import type { Service } from './service';

const counter = ({ signal, computed }: Service) => (initial = 0) => {
  const count = signal(initial);
  const doubled = computed(() => count() * 2);

  return {
    count,
    doubled,
    increment: () => count(count() + 1),
    decrement: () => count(count() - 1),
    reset: () => count(initial),
  };
};
```

### Using It

```typescript
import { svc } from './service';

// Oh look! svc itself is callable and injects the svc for you! Neat!
const useCounter = svc(counter);
const c = useCounter(10);

c.count();
c.increment();
c.doubled();
```

`svc(counter)` provides (or injects) the service (and is type safe). Then you have a ready-to-use behavior bound to your service that you can name whatever you want. Again, by convention (NOT prescription) we prefix with `use*` for nice semantics and ergonomics.

## Composing Behaviors

The double-function behavior pattern is quite powerful for composition. Behaviors can easily compose other behaviors. To demonstrate this, let's start with a basic portable behavior:

```typescript
const disclosure = ({ signal }: Service) => (initialOpen = false) => {
  const isOpen = signal(initialOpen);

  return {
    isOpen,
    open: () => isOpen(true),
    close: () => isOpen(false),
    toggle: () => isOpen(!isOpen()),
  };
};
```

Now, we can compose it:

```typescript
const dropdown = (svc: Service) => {
  // Another convention is to use the outer function as a "service layer", but you could
  // do this in the return function if you don't mind it running on every mount.
  const useDisclosure = svc(disclosure);

  return (options?: { initialOpen?: boolean }) => {
    const disc = useDisclosure(options?.initialOpen ?? false);

    // Add keyboard handling
    // Look ma, no memoization required!
    const onKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      if (e.key !== 'Enter') return;
      e.preventDefault();
      disc.toggle();
    };

    return {
      ...disc,
      onKeyDown,
    };
  };
};
```

Now `dropdown` composes `disclosure`! They both use the same behavior shape of `(svc) => (args) => api`, but one composes the other. In rimitive, we call the outer function the **service layer**. It's a convenient place to inject services a single time.

## Testing

Behaviors are trivial to test. Just import your service:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { svc } from './service';

describe('counter', () => {
  it('increments', () => {
    const c = svc(counter)(0);

    c.increment();
    c.increment();

    expect(c.count()).toBe(2);
  });

  it('respects initial value', () => {
    const c = svc(counter)(50);

    expect(c.count()).toBe(50);
    c.reset();
    expect(c.count()).toBe(50);
  });
});
```

Pure functions, pure tests. Again, if this is all you need, you can stop here. If you want a reactive UI and UI components, as the kids say, "let's gooooo".
