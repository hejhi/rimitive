Lattice is designed to have a minimal impact on your bundle size while providing maximum flexibility.

## Key Characteristics

<Card title="Tiny Footprint" icon="rocket">
  Lattice has an extremely small footprint and is fully tree-shakeable:
  
  - **Zero dependencies** - No external libraries bundled
  - **Modular design** - Import only what you need
  - **Tree-shakeable** - Unused code is automatically removed
  - **TypeScript-first** - No runtime type checking overhead
</Card>

## Tree-Shaking Advantage

<Aside type="tip">
  Lattice is completely composable - import only what you need!
</Aside>

```typescript
// Minimal imports for basic state management
import { createStore } from '@lattice/core/store';

// Add composition when you need it
import { compose } from '@lattice/core/compose';

// Full toolkit when building complex applications
import { createSlice, compose } from '@lattice/core';
```

## Adapter Strategy

Each adapter is designed to be lightweight and leverage your existing state management libraries:

- **`@lattice/adapter-store-react`** - Direct React state integration
- **`@lattice/adapter-zustand`** - Builds on Zustand's minimalism
- **`@lattice/adapter-redux`** - Works with your existing Redux setup

## Performance Benefits

The small bundle size translates to real performance benefits:

- **Faster initial page loads** due to smaller JavaScript bundles
- **Better tree-shaking** means only the code you use gets bundled
- **No runtime overhead** from unnecessary features you don't use
- **Framework-agnostic core** reduces duplication across different UI libraries
