Concerned about bundle size? You should be! Let's look at the real numbers and see how Lattice compares to other state management solutions.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Core Package - Fully Composable!

<Aside type="tip">
  Lattice is completely composable - import only what you need!
</Aside>

| Import Path | Size (gzipped) | What you get |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| `@lattice/core` | 1.1 KB | Complete toolkit (all features) |
| `@lattice/core/base` | 0.2 KB | Lightweight: createStore + compose |
| `@lattice/core/compose` | 0.2 KB | Just the compose utility |
| `@lattice/core/store` | 0.1 KB | Just createStore primitive |
| `@lattice/core/subscribe` | 0.3 KB | Subscription utilities |
| `@lattice/core/runtime` | 0.4 KB | Runtime adapter integration |

### Runtime Package

| Package | Size (gzipped) | What it does |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| `@lattice/runtime` | 0.3 KB | Framework hooks (useSliceValues, etc.) |

## Adapters

| Adapter | Size (gzipped) | Use when |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| `@lattice/adapter-store-react` | 0.6 KB | New React projects (fastest) |
| `@lattice/adapter-zustand` | 0.5 KB | Already using Zustand |
| `@lattice/adapter-redux` | 0.7 KB | Already using Redux |
| `@lattice/adapter-svelte` | 0.7 KB | Svelte projects |

## Complete Setup Sizes

| Setup | Total Size | Breakdown |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| React + store-react | 1.5 KB | Core (1.1) + Runtime (0.3) + Adapter (0.6) |
| React + Redux | 1.9 KB | Core (1.1) + Runtime (0.3) + Adapter (0.7) |
| React + Zustand | 1.7 KB | Core (1.1) + Runtime (0.3) + Adapter (0.5) |

## The Composability Advantage

<Card title="Tree Shaking" icon="puzzle">
  Use only what you need:
  
  ```typescript
  // Just need state? (0.1 KB)
  import { createStore } from '@lattice/core/store';
  
  // Add composition when ready (+0.2 KB)
  import { compose } from '@lattice/core/compose';
  
  // Full power when you need it (1.1 KB total)
  import { createSlice, compose } from '@lattice/core';
  ```
