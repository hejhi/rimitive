title: Using a Service
description: Different ways to use a reactive service in your code.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Once you've [created a service](/guides/creating-a-service), there are a few ways to use it.

---

## Exporting a Service

You can safely destructure anything in Rimitive from a service, so for simpler use cases, you can export the return of a service:

```typescript
// myService.ts

export const { signal, computed } = compose(SignalModule, ComputedModule);
```

But `svc` is also call-able. So it's more idiomatic to export the service and service type if you're looking for a more durable pattern:

```typescript
// myService.ts

export const svc = compose(SignalModule, ComputedModule);
export type Service = typeof svc;
```

For now though, we'll continue exporting the destructured parts for simplicity.

---

## In a Function

Rimitive makes heavy usage of factory functions that look like components or hooks you might be used to from other frameworks:

```typescript
import { signal } from './myService.ts'

const useCounter = () => {
  const count = signal(0);
  const increment = () => count(count() + 1);

  return { count, increment };
};

const counter = useCounter();
counter.increment();
counter.count(); // 1
```

A nuance here is that the above is **a plain function** that instantiates reactive state and returns an api to drive it 🚗. In Rimitive, this pattern is called a ["behavior"](/guides/creating-a-behavior), which is conventionally prefixed with `use*` for clarity (ie `useCounter` instead of `myCounter` or something).

<Aside type="note">
For those coming from reactive frameworks, prefixing with `use*` in rimitive is **only a naming convention and nice semantics**. It doesn't confer any reactive abilities, or require you to obey any rules in how it's used.
</Aside>

You can stop right here, if that's all you need! For plenty of apps simple apps, direct service exports and simple behaviors might be enough.

If you want to drive a reactive ui with state, Rimitive also has modules and patterns to help you with that.

Next up though, let's talk more about the [behavior pattern](/guides/creating-a-behavior).
