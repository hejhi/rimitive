## ReactiveSvc type

Minimal constraint for reactive services used with createHook. Behaviors can require more specific services - this is just the floor.

**Signature:**

```typescript
type ReactiveSvc = {
    signal: <T>(initialValue: T) => Writable<T>;
    computed: <T>(fn: () => T) => Readable<T>;
    effect: (fn: () => void | (() => void)) => () => void;
};
```
