## SignalSvc type

Minimal service interface used by React bindings. Contains the core methods for creating and managing signals.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type SignalSvc = {
    signal: <T>(value: T) => Writable<T>;
    computed: <T>(compute: () => T) => Readable<T>;
    effect: (fn: () => void | (() => void)) => () => void;
    batch: <T>(fn: () => T) => T;
    dispose: () => void;
};
```
**References:** [Writable](../../signals/writable/)<!-- -->, [Readable](../../signals/readable/)

## Example


```tsx
import { compose, coreExtensions } from '@lattice/signals';

const svc: SignalSvc = compose(...coreExtensions);
```
