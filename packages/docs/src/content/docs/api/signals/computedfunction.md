## ComputedFunction type

Computed function type - a callable that derives values from other reactives.

Computeds are lazy: they only recompute when read and their dependencies have changed. Use `.peek()` to read without tracking dependencies.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type ComputedFunction<T = unknown> = {
    (): T;
    peek(): T;
};
```

## Example


```ts
const count = signal(5);
const doubled: ComputedFunction<number> = computed(() => count() * 2);

doubled();     // computes: 10
doubled();     // cached: 10
count(10);     // marks doubled as stale
doubled();     // recomputes: 20
doubled.peek(); // read without tracking: 20
```
