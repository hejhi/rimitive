## createSignalsSvc() function

Create a fully-configured signals service.

This is the main entry point for using Lattice signals. Returns a service with all primitives wired up and ready to use.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare function createSignalsSvc(): SignalsSvc;
```
**Returns:**

[SignalsSvc](./signalssvc/)

A signals service with all primitives and a dispose method

## Example 1

Basic usage

```ts
import { createSignalsSvc } from '@lattice/signals/presets/core';

const { signal, computed, effect, batch, subscribe } = createSignalsSvc();

// Create reactive state
const count = signal(0);
const doubled = computed(() => count() * 2);

// React to changes
effect(() => {
  console.log(`Count: ${count()}, Doubled: ${doubled()}`);
});

// Update state
count(5); // Effect runs, logs: "Count: 5, Doubled: 10"
```

## Example 2

With cleanup

```ts
const svc = createSignalsSvc();

// ... use signals ...

// Clean up when done (e.g., in tests or when unmounting)
svc.dispose();
```

## Example 3

Subscribing to changes

```ts
const { signal, subscribe } = createSignalsSvc();

const name = signal('Alice');

// Subscribe only re-runs when the tracked value changes
const unsubscribe = subscribe(
  () => name(),
  (value) => console.log(`Name changed to: ${value}`)
);

name('Bob');   // logs: "Name changed to: Bob"
name('Bob');   // no log (value unchanged)
unsubscribe(); // stop listening
```
