## SignalFunction type

Signal function type - a callable that acts as both getter and setter.

Call with no arguments to read, call with a value to write. Use `.peek()` to read without tracking dependencies.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type SignalFunction<T> = Writable<T> & {
    peek(): T;
};
```
**References:** [Writable](./writable/)

## Example


```ts
const count: SignalFunction<number> = signal(0);

count();      // read: 0
count(5);     // write
count();      // read: 5
count.peek(); // read without tracking: 5
```
