## Reactive type

Union type for any reactive value (readable or writable).

Use this when a function accepts either signals or computeds.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type Reactive<T> = Readable<T> | Writable<T>;
```
**References:** [Readable](../readable/)<!-- -->, [Writable](../writable/)

## Example


```ts
// Function that works with any reactive value
function double(source: Reactive<number>): Readable<number> {
  return computed(() => source() * 2);
}

const count = signal(5);
const doubled = double(count); // Works with signal

const derived = computed(() => count() + 1);
const derivedDoubled = double(derived); // Works with computed too
```
