## Type Aliases

<table><thead><tr><th>

Type Alias


</th><th>

Description


</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>

[BatchFactory](../batchfactory/)


</td><td>

The batch function type - groups multiple signal writes into a single update cycle.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[ComputedFactory](../computedfactory/)


</td><td>

Computed factory function type - creates computed values from computation functions


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[ComputedFunction](../computedfunction/)


</td><td>

Computed function type - a callable that derives values from other reactives.

Computeds are lazy: they only recompute when read and their dependencies have changed. Use `.peek()` to read without tracking dependencies.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[EffectFactory](../effectfactory/)


</td><td>

The effect factory function type


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[Reactive](../reactive/)


</td><td>

Union type for any reactive value (readable or writable).

Use this when a function accepts either signals or computeds.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[Readable](../readable/)


</td><td>

A readable reactive value (signal or computed).

Call with no arguments to read the current value. Reading inside a reactive context (effect, computed) creates a dependency.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[SignalFactory](../signalfactory/)


</td><td>

The signal factory function type


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[SignalFunction](../signalfunction/)


</td><td>

Signal function type - a callable that acts as both getter and setter.

Call with no arguments to read, call with a value to write. Use `.peek()` to read without tracking dependencies.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[SubscribeCallback](../subscribecallback/)


</td><td>

Callback invoked when the source value changes


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[SubscribeFunction](../subscribefunction/)


</td><td>

Subscribe function type - tracks source dependencies, calls callback on change.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[UnsubscribeFunction](../unsubscribefunction/)


</td><td>

Function to stop the subscription


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[Writable](../writable/)


</td><td>

A writable reactive value (signal).

Call with no arguments to read, call with a value to write. Writing notifies all subscribers.


</td></tr>
