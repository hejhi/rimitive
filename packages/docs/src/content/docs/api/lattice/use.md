## Use type

A callable returned by `compose()` that provides access to the service context.

Can be called in two ways: - `use()` - Returns the service context directly - `use(callback)` - Passes the context to callback and returns its result

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type Use<TSvc> = {
    (): TSvc;
    <TResult>(callback: (svc: TSvc) => TResult): TResult;
};
```

## Example


```ts
const use = compose({ signal: Signal() }, deps);

// Get the service directly
const { signal, computed } = use();

// Wrap a component with service access
const Counter = use(({ signal, computed }) => () => {
  const count = signal(0);
  return el('div')(computed(() => count()));
});
```
