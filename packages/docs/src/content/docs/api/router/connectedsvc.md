## ConnectedSvc type

Connected service - merged view service + route service

This is the service passed to connected components, enabling them to use whatever adapter is provided (hydrating or regular) rather than pulling from a singleton.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type ConnectedSvc<TConfig extends AdapterConfig> = ViewSvc<TConfig> & RouteSvc;
```
**References:** [AdapterConfig](../../view/adapterconfig/)<!-- -->, [ViewSvc](../viewsvc/)<!-- -->, [RouteSvc](../routesvc/)
