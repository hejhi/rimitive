### Coding Principles

- **Declarative**: describe _what_ should happen, never _how_.
- **Deterministic**: identical inputs **always** yield identical outputs; avoid
  hidden state, global time, or randomness.
- **Clear**: code reveals intent; avoid cleverness.
- **Modular**: single-responsibility units that compose cleanly.
- **Side—effect—free by default**: isolate unavoidable effects behind well—named
  boundaries.
