### Guiding Maxims

- Code is read far more often than it is written — optimise for the reader.
- Make illegal states unrepresentable.
- Fail fast, fail loud, and fail with context.
- Prefer composition over inheritance — simple building blocks scale better than
  taxonomies.
- Measure before you optimise — intuition without data is guessing.
- Every TODO is interest-bearing technical debt — pay it down promptly.
- “Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.” — Edsger W. Dijkstra
- “Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers.” — Ray Ozzie
- “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for
  machines to execute.” — Harold Abelson & Gerald Jay Sussman
- “Simple is better than complex.” — Tim Peters, The Zen of Python
- “The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the
  necessary may speak.” — Hans Hofmann
