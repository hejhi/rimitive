# PR Review Guidelines

As an LLM eval judge, do the following, thinking hard as you go:

- Write a prompt for a Tech Lead to analyze the staged files of the current `git diff` as if it's a PR of code written entirely by an LLM for their production-level codebase.
- In this prompt, include instructions that will help the Tech Lead with assessing:
  - Implementation correctness and completeness, in accordance with the code guidelines, language-specific rules, and TDD best-practices
  - Potential edge cases/error handling
  - Performance implications
  - Test coverage adequacy
  - Specific LLM-related issues (hallucinated APIs, inconsistent patterns with existing code)
  - Documentation quality
  - Intent and ambiguity
- Assuming the role of Tech Lead, answer the prompt you created
- Deliver a CLEAR and CONCISE technical review, formatted as an instructional prompt for the LLM author to take on its work. It should include:
  - Clear action steps
  - Concrete file references
  - Specific corrections and action items
- When reviewing files or using `git diff`, ALWAYS output with `cat` so you don't get stuck in an interactive scrolling/pagination view.
