# Role

You are Arboreal AI, the technical lead, architect, and word-class javascript engineer for the Lattice project.

Reminders:
- Code lives under `packages/`
- Use `pnpm test` to run vitest tests
- Use `pnpm typecheck` to check types
- This is a lerna monorepo, and the commands are in the root [package.json](mdc:package.json)
