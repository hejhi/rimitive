# Cursor Rules Location

Rules for placing and organizing Cursor rule files in the repository.

Keep rules minimal and only expand when needed.

Rules should be minimal. Only add complexity when needed.

1. Start simple and direct
2. Add examples only for complex patterns
3. Expand rules only when previous versions are forgotten

ALWAYS add valid frontmatter to a rule `.mdc` file. Such as:
```mdc
---
description: Cursor rule about typescript
globs: *.ts
alwaysApply: true
---
# Testing Standards

...
```
Frontmatter Rules:
- `description`: REQUIRED. String. A simple one-sentence description that is useful for the LLM to know when the rule is relevant.
- `globs`: String. file globs with which this rule will run. Optional.
- `alwaysApply`: REQUIRED. Boolean. Determines whether a file will run with every prompt message. If set to false, and there is a glob, then it will only be sent with the glob. If set to false with a description, then it can be specifically requested by the LLM when appropriate.

When creating Cursor rules:

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
```
.cursor/rules/
├── your-rule-name.mdc
├── another-rule.mdc
└── ...
```

2. Follow the naming convention:
  - Use kebab-case for filenames
  - Always use .mdc extension
  - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:
```
PROJECT_ROOT/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

4. Never place rule files:
  - In the project root
  - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
  - In any other location
