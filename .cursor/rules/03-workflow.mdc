# Workflow

Analyze first:
1. Clarify the task if needed; the user is there to resolve ambiguity. NEVER GUESS OR ASSUME. Ask questions. Seek guidance. Stay curious.
2. Open / search the relevant spec file(s) and source files.
3. Plan briefly, then implement or answer, citing files consulted.

Implement second: ALWAYS follow TDD methodology, following these exact steps when creating, updating, and ESPECIALLY debugging, code:
1. Keep a **single, version-controlled Test Case Backlog** for each feature or module.
2. Development loop (Red → Green → Refactor):
   1. **Select** the highest-priority test case from the backlog.
   2. **Write the test** so that it **fails** (Red).
   3. **Implement only the minimal code** required for the test to **pass** (Green).
   4. **Refactor** production *and* test code to improve clarity, remove duplication, and uphold these standards (Refactor).
   5. Return to step 1.
3. Expand or revise the Test Case Backlog whenever new behaviour or edge cases are discovered.
